# society-collapse
Interactive app of a model of society collapse. This is based on the model of [Motesharrei et al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800914000615), who created a 4-equation model for accumulation of wealth and depletion of natural resources with different consumption rates of commoners and elites.

With some settings, equilibrium can be achieved. In others, there are several modes of cycles of collapse, or complete collapse, depending on the extent of consumption or whether nature recovers when humanity dies or not.

As the authors had noted, several aspects are rather simplified: 

* All natural resources are regenerating in this version, while in reality some are consumed (petroleum) or transformed (metals). Even forests that are completely torn down may not necessarily return as forest, and instead as grasslands.
* Birth rates are the same for the two classes, and this parameter is unchanging.
* Death rate changes, but only depending on starvation when the natural resources are used up, meaning no possibilities of plagues or disasters.
